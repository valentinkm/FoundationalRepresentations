When you feel completely aroused you should indicate this by choosing rating 1. The other end of the scale is relaxed, calm, sluggish, dull, sleepy, or unaroused. You can indicate feeling completely calm by selecting 9. The numbers also allow you to describe intermediate feelings of calmness/arousal.
